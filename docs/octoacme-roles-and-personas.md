## Related Process Update

**Issue Title:** Adding more personas and roles to the project management processes

**Summary:**
The current project management documentation defines core roles but lacks coverage for several critical responsibilities such as architecture, operations, and user experience. This issue proposes expanding the documented personas to improve clarity, accountability, and cross-functional collaboration.

**Why this is important:**

* Reduces role ambiguity and decision bottlenecks
* Improves quality, scalability, and operational readiness
* Enhances stakeholder alignment and delivery predictability

**Proposed Personas to Add:**

* Technical Architect
* DevOps / Platform Engineer
* UX / Design Lead

**Expected Outcome:**
A more comprehensive and practical roles-and-personas reference that improves planning, execution, and delivery across OctoAcme projects.
